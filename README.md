## Design

### Design Choices
The website was designed to reflect the industrial design of most computers. The company does add a vinyl skin to their computers depending upon the chosen design and to reflect this I have added some imagery and colour that the gaming industry uses to reflect computer gaming.

### Colour

For the colour scheme the company owners chose to use a grey theme and highlight with mainly red and a little bit of blue to draw attention to certain areas while still reflecting both the industrial and gaming themes. To narrow down the colours I used https://coolors.co/.
<br>

### Fonts
The business owners preferred the use of Inter font as the main, with a backup of sans-serif across the website. This is used to maintain a Consistent and professional look with an easily readable format. 
<br>
For the Secondary font the owners decided to use Quicksand with a backup of sans-serif, this will be used for emphasis and future changes to the website should there be major content updates. 

### Structure
The page is structured in a regularly used, well know, user friendly, and easy to navigate. Upon arriving to the website, the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar with the company name on the left side and the navigation links to the links along the top. 
The website consists of four separate pages: 
- A homepage with a section for “What We Do”, “Cheap and Powerful Gaming” and “Your PC Your Way”.
- A products page with a carousel and information about all the products available.
- A contact us page with a contact form, a map, and the company office location.
- An about us page with the information about the owners, the security measures they take and the additional services they can offer.
