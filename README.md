## Features to implement in the future

- Chat bot
    - This was a request from the owners, this would require significant investment and can be implemented after the main launch.
- FAQ page
    - As a new company that uses used and refurbished hardware their users are likely to ask very similar questions about they quality of the products, these can often be answered by an FAQ page instead of speaking to members of the team who could be busy with other tasks.
-  Age appropiate theme
    - Using the standard Dark/Light theme technique that a lot of websites implement one suggestion the owners asked for was a version targeted towards children and young adults and a version that adults can use without the distractions that allow them to make informed purchases.
- Order system
    - Simple order system for orders that do not require any sales team intervention, this free's up time for the sales team to focus on the people who really need help instead of people who already know what they want.

## The business wants this website to acheive:
- An easy way to view and find the information relating to their products.
- An easy way of contacting the sales and support teams with any questions.

## Typeface and Colours:

- Colours:
    - When consulting the business owner and looking at a number of other websites from other competitors, as well as market reviews, we determined that the majority of people making the purchase will be adults buying for children or young adults.
    - We found that while children would be more persuaded by a bright and shiny theme, the adult purchasing is far more likely to use the website if it included a consistant, neutral theme with a slight emphasis around specific items of interest.
    - To give feeling that the website has a high quality, the business owner has agreed upon the use of greys and red hues where appropiate to allow certain items to stand out. As the background will be a darker colour the text will be set to white to aid in accessibiltity

- Typeface:
    - The businsess owner preferred the use of "Inter" font with a backup of sans-serif for all headings and body content across the website. This was chosen to maintain a consistant and professional look across the whole website in an easily readable format.
    - The owner also decided to choose "Quicksand" with a backup of sans-serif for all future changes and updates to the website should we want to update the content for future versions.
