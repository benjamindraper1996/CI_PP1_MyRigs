## MY RIGS

A new online only PC sales company website, headquartered in Braintree, The United Kingdom. The Website will feature a number of images of their products available to purchase. Helping to inform visitors to the website of the products available the website will consist of multiple separate pages to include a description of the business with their goals and ethos, A page for all their products with images representing each design and a description accompanying it. There will also be “Contact Us” page to contact the team about any sales inquiries or support.

The main goal is to show case the products on offer and give customers the ability to make first contact with the business via the contact page.

#### Typeface and Colours:

- Colours:
    - When consulting the business owner and looking at a number of other websites from other competitors, as well as market reviews, we determined that the majority of people making the purchase will be adults buying for children or young adults.
    - We found that while children would be more persuaded by a bright and shiny theme, the adult purchasing is far more likely to use the website if it included a consistant, neutral theme with a slight emphasis around specific items of interest.
    - To give feeling that the website has a high quality, the business owner has agreed upon the use of greys and red hues where appropiate to allow certain items to stand out. As the background will be a darker colour the text will be set to white to aid in accessibiltity

- Typeface:
    - The businsess owner preferred the use of "Inter" font with a backup of sans-serif for all headings and body content across the website. This was chosen to maintain a consistant and professional look across the whole website in an easily readable format.
    - The owner also decided to choose "Quicksand" with a backup of sans-serif for all future changes and updates to the website should we want to update the content for future versions.
